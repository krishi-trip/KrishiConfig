# KrishiConfig

### These are my config files for emacs, vim, iterm, etc. They are simple and efficient. Enjoy!

NVIM Setup:
- Download Neovim
- Download Astrovim
- Download my init.lua and replace the one in ~/.config/nvim/lua/user/init.lua
- Download my colors folder and replace the one in ~/.config/nvim/colors/
- Reload Neovim, and ensure it is working properly (and all plugins/themes)
- Use TSInstall and LspInstall as needed for the language and editing support
